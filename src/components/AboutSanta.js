    <h2>Because Why Not? 🤷‍♂️</h2>
    <p>
      Okay, so I was supposed to write something meaningful here, but instead 
      I&apos;m just gonna hit you with some random Santa facts I found. 
      Consider this my way of being festive AND lazy at the same time! 😂
    </p>
    <ul className="list">
      <li>Santa&apos;s reindeer can apparently fly at 650 miles per SECOND (which is faster than light, so that&apos;s definitely not real, but who cares? It&apos;s Christmas! 🦌)</li>
      <li> So i am susil from kannayakumari (in xmas people call it as mini GOA) </li>
      <li> ..................nothing just passonate about pitching my first product to the world  </li>
      <li>Fun fact: I spent way too much time researching this instead of just buying you a normal gift. You&apos;re welcome! 😅</li>
    </ul>
    <p style={{ marginTop: '25px', fontStyle: 'italic', color: '#ffd700' }}>
      P.S. - Yes, I know some of these facts are questionable. It&apos;s the thought that counts, right? 😉
